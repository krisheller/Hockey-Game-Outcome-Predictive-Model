Project to aggregate NHL data and eventually build a predictive model for games and player outcomes


Goals:
    1) Develop dataset from historical data, pulling from the NHL api individual game stats per player -> This is basically done!
    2) Run the API each day to capture and append stats from that day's games -> This is basically done!
    3) Develop metrics to evaluate player value and team success -> WIP
    4) Combine player and team metrics along with injury data and build a predictive model -> WIP

Stretch Goals:
    1) Pair up with a sportsbook API and evluate high-value opportunities for mispricing -> WIP
    2) push to a website to keep live at all times -> Not yet started
