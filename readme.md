Project to aggregate NHL data and eventually build a predictive model for games and player outcomes


Goals:
    1) Develop dataset from historical data, pulling from the NHL api individual game stats per player
    2) Run the API each day to capture and append stats from that day's games
    3) Develop metrics to evaluate player value and team success
    4) Combine player and team metrics along with injury data and build a predictive model

Stretch Goals:
    1) Pair up with a sportsbook API and evluate high-value opportunities for mispricing
    2) push to a website to keep live at all times
